## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Enhanced DCCI Framework Features

#### 1. Dynamic Capability Assessment
The enhanced DCCI framework now evaluates **26 individual security metrics** across three capability dimensions:

**Calculation Method**:
```
Overall Score = (Technological × 0.4) + (Organizational × 0.3) + (Managerial × 0.3)

Where each capability = Average of its component metrics
```

#### 2. Real-Time Dynamic Adjustments
The framework adjusts scores based on real-time security factors:

**Technological Adjustments**:
- Increases by 3% when threat level is LOW with zero violations
- Decreases by 5% when threat level is HIGH or CRITICAL

**Organizational Adjustments**:
- Scales by account compliance rate (unlocked/total accounts)

**Managerial Adjustments**:
- Scales by security event management efficiency (positive events/total events)

#### 3. Enhanced Grading System
**New Grade Scale**:
- A+ (95-100%) - Outstanding
- A (90-94%) - Excellent
- A- (85-89%) - Very Good
- B+ (80-84%) - Good
- B (75-79%) - Above Average
- B- (70-74%) - Average
- C+ (65-69%) - Below Average
- C (60-64%) - Needs Improvement
- D (<60%) - Critical Improvement Needed

#### 4. Research-Backed Recommendations
Each security recommendation now includes:
- Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Specific action items
- Scientific research citation
- Target capability area
